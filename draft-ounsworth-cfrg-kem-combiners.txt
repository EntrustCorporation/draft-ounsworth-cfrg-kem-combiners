    Combiner function for hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)
                 draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners-00

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing
   multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their
   outputs to derive a single shared secret.

   This document defines the KEM combiner KDF( H(ss1) || H(ss2) ) which
   is considered to be a dual PRF in practice, even though not provably
   secure.  This mechanism simplifies to KDF( ss1 || ss2 ) when used
   with a KEM which internally uses a KDF to produce its shared secret.
   RSA-KEM, ECDH, Edwards curve DH, and CRYSTALS-Kyber are shown to meet
   this criteria and therefore be safe to use with the simplified KEM
   combiner.

      Mechanism (KEM) made up of two or more component KEM algorithms
      where at least one is a post-quantum algorithm and at least one is
      a traditional algorithm.

   Building a PQ/T hybrid KEM requires a secure function which combines
   the output of both component KEMs to form a single output.  Several
   IETF protocols are adding PQ/T hybrid KEM mechanisms as part of their
   overall post-quantum migration strategies, examples include TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], IKEv2
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-multiple-ke], X.509; PKIX; CMS
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-kem], OpenPGP (CITE once Aron's draft is
   up), JOSE / COSE (CITE once Orie's drafts are up).

   This document normalizes a mechanisms for combining the output of two
   KEMs

2.1.  Key Encapsulation Mechanisms

   For the purposes of this document, we consider a Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism (KEM) to be any asymmetric cryptographic scheme comprised
   of algorithms satisfying the following interfaces [PQCAPI].

   def kemKeyGen() -> (pk, sk)
   def kemEncaps(pk) -> (ct, ss)
   def kemDecaps(ct, sk) -> ss

   where pk is public key, sk is secret key, ct is ciphertext, and ss is
   shared secret.

   KEMs are typically used in cases where two parties, hereby refereed
   to as the "encapsulater" and the "decapsulater", wish to establish a
   shared secret via public key cryptography, where the decapsulater has
   an asymmetric key pair and has previously shared the public key with
   the encapsulater.

3.  KEM Combiner

   A KEM combiner is a function that takes in two shared secrets and
   returns a combined shared secret, where all values are byte arrays.

   ss = kemCombiner(ss1, ss2)

   This document assumes that shared secrets are the output of a KEM,
   but without loss of generality they may also be a pre-shared key
   (PSK) or any other source of cryptographic key material that
   implementers wish to combine with the output of a KEM, which is a
   post-safe migration strategy being adopted by some protocols, see for
   example IKEv2 in [RFC8784].

Internet-Draft                KEM Combiner                 November 2022


   In general it is desirable to use a dual PRF, a dual-input PRF which
   is keyed off either input, as a KEM combiner (see Appendix A.1 for a
   discussion of dual PRFs).  We take the following construction as a
   dual PRF in practice, and therefore suitable for use in all IETF
   protocols that need to combine the output of two KEMs:

   ss = kemCombiner(ss1, ss2) = KDF( H(ss1) || H(ss2) )

                Figure 1: general KEM combiner construction

   where KDF represents a suitable choice of cryptographic key
   derivation function, H represents a cryptographic hash function, ss1
   and ss2 represent the outputs of the first and second KEMs, and ||
   represents concatenation.  KDF and H are assumed to behave as random
   oracles.

   See Appendix A.2 for security analysis on the safety of using this
   combiner with RSA-KEM [RFC5990], elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
   [SEC1], Edwards curve Diffie-Hellman [RFC7748], and CRYSTALS-Kyber
   [I-D.cfrg-schwabe-kyber].  All of these cryptographic algorithms are
   found to have a KDF or cryptographic hash as the last step before
   output of the shared secret, and therefore the KEM combiner
   construction may be simplified to the following when used with
   combinations of the analyzed cryptographic algorithms.

   ss = kemCombiner(ss1, ss2) = KDF( ss1 || ss2 )

     Figure 2: simplified KEM combiner construction when both KEMs are
                       known to provide strong output

   This simplified combiner proposed as a KEM combiner, for example in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design].

   In the case that more than two shared secrets need to be combined,
   the above construction can be extended in the obvious way:

   ss = kemCombiner(ss1, ss2, ss3, ... )
         = KDF( H(ss1) || H(ss2) || H(ss3) ... )

      Figure 3: KEM combiner construction for combining more than two
                               shared secrets

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

5.  Security Considerations

   This work assumes that the KEM combiner defined in Section 3 is a
   dual PRF in practice, despite the lack of security proof.  As the
   academic literature progresses towards provably secure dual PRFs,
   this document may need to be obsoleted in favour of a more robust
   primitive.

   It is important to note that the analysis herein pertains to the
   specific cryptographic algorithms analyzed and do not necessarily
   generalize to other constructions, even if they are based on the same
   underlying primitive.  Specifically it depends on whether the shared
   secret produced by the KEM is the output of a fixed and secure key
   derivation function which makes the length and value of the shared
   secret beyond the direct control of the initiator of the KEM.

Appendix A.  Security Analysis

A.1.  Dual PRF

   Dual PRFs are a active area of research.  A dual PRF is a function
   which is a PRF when keyed by either of its two inputs - guaranteeing
   pseudo-randomness if one of the keys is compromised or even
   maliciously chosen by an adversary [Aviram2022].  As of publication
   of this document, no dual PRFs have been standardized for use.  In
   practice we often use HMACs or HKDFs to serve the role of a dual PRF
   even though they have never been proved to be dual PRFs
   [Bellare2015], [Aviram2022].

   In essence, this document assumes that KDF( H(input1) || H(input2))
   is a dual PRF in practice, for suitable choices of key derivation
   function KDF and hash function H, despite not having formal security
   proofs.  It has been proposed as a KEM combiner, for example in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design].  As the academic literature evolves, it
   may become appropriate to obsolete this document with a KEM combiner
   based on a provably secure dual PRF.

A.2.  KEM primitives

   In modern cryptographic design, KEM algorithms seek to have
   indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-
   CCA2).  For hybrid KEMs we desire the additional property that the
   combiner, without loss of generality, leaks no information about ss2
   even if ss1 is controlled by an attacker.

   There are two ways to achieve such a hybrid KEM combiner; either by
   designing a combiner that is robust to one of the inputs being
   maliciously-chosen, called a dual PRF.  See Appendix A.1 for a
   discussion about the current state of dual PRF research.  Or
   alternatively by only allowing the hybridization of KEMs where a
   malicious kemEncaps() algorithm cannot control the shared secret
   derived by the victim's kemDecaps() algorithm and then combining the
   shared secrets in a trivial way.

   The following sections analyze commonly-used KEM algorithms to show
   that they have the following two properties, and are therefore
   suitable for use with the simplified KEM combiner presented in
   Section 3, Figure 2.

   1.  A malicious encapsulater cannot control the length of the KEM
       output (shared secret) that will be derived by the decapsulater.

   2.  A malicious encapsulater cannot control the value of the KEM
       output (shared secret) that will be derived by the decapsulater.
       We define a KEM output to be "controlled by an attacker" if a
       maliciously-written kemEncaps() function can cause the victim's
       kemDecaps() algorithm to produce a shared secret either of a
       length chosen by the attacker, or to take on a given value with
       higher probability than can be obtained via rejection sampling on
       the shared secret output of kemEncaps().

A.3.  RSA-KEM

   RSA encryption [RFC3447] can be promoted into a KEM as per [RFC5990]
   which defines a key transport based on RSA-KEM.

   1. Generate a random integer z between 0 and n-1 (see note), and
     convert z to a byte string Z of length nLen, most significant byte
     first:

         z = RandomInteger (0, n-1)

         Z = IntegerToString (z, nLen)

   2. Encrypt the random integer z using the recipient's public key
     (n,e), and convert the resulting integer c to a ciphertext C, a
     byte string of length nLen:

         c = z^e mod n

         C = IntegerToString (c, nLen)

   3. Derive a key-encrypting key KEK of length kekLen bytes from the
     byte string Z using the underlying key derivation function:

         KEK = KDF (Z, kekLen)

   4. Wrap the keying data K with the key-encrypting key KEK using the
     underlying key-wrapping scheme to obtain wrapped keying data WK:

         WK = Wrap (KEK, K)

   5. Concatenate the ciphertext C and the wrapped keying data WK to
     obtain the encrypted keying data EK:

         EK = C || WK

   6. Output the encrypted keying data EK.

   where Steps 1 - 3 define "RSA-KEM", which is considered here.  Steps
   4 - 6 define "Key Transport based on RSA-KEM" and is out of scope for
   this analysis as we assume that any RSA-KEM construction intended for
   use in a hybrid KEM would use the KEK output from Step 3 as the final
   shared secret.

   Here the transported symmetric key, KEK, is the KEM output (shared
   secret) ss as defined in Section 2.1.  The encapsulater must choose a
   key derivation function KDF and declare it in the RSA-KEM parameters.
   The decapsulater may refuse to perform the the decapsulation if it
   does not like the encapsulater's choice of KDF, therefore it can be
   modeled as a random oracle producing an output of fixed length.  The
   attacker is free to choose z, but assuming a strong choice of KDF,
   they cannot control either the length or the value KEK beyond what
   can be obtained by rejection sampling, thus satisfying properties 1
   and 2 and defined in {.sec-kemprimitives}}.

   Therefore RSA-KEM is considered to be suitable for use with the
   simplified KEM combiner defined in Section 3, Figure 2.

   Security note: This analysis applies to the specific RSA-KEM
   construction defined above.  This result is not intended to
   generalize to all RSA-based key transport mechanisms, as they may not

   The elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange [SEC1] can be promoted
   into a KEM in a straightforward way by assuming an ephemeral-static
   (ES) mode where def kemEncaps(pk) -> (ct, ss) includes generation of
   an ephemeral key pair, the public key being included as part of the
   ciphertext ct and the private key being discarded upon completion of
   the encapsulation.

   According to [SEC1] section 6.1.3:

 1. Use one of the Diffie-Hellman primitives specified in Section 3.3 to
    derive a shared secret field element z ∈ Fq from U's secret key d_U
    established during the key deployment procedure and V's public key
    Q_V obtained during the key deployment procedure. If the Diffie-
    Hellman primitive outputs “invalid”, output “invalid” and stop.
    Decide whether to use the “standard” elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
    primitive or the elliptic curve cofactor Diffie-Hellman primitive
    according to the convention established during the setup procedure.

 2. Convert z ∈ Fq to an octet string Z using the conversion routine
    specified in Section 2.3.5.

 3. Use the key derivation function KDF established during the setup
    procedure to generate keying data K of length keydatalen octets
    from Z and [SharedInfo]. If the key derivation function outputs
    “invalid”, output “invalid” and stop.

 4. Output K.

   Other key exchange methods defined in [SEC1] follow a similar
   construction.

   The attacker is free to choose a private key d_U which yields a
   shared secret Z, but cannot force Z to take on a chosen value without
   solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem or performing
   rejection sampling.  Assuming a strong choice of KDF, the attacker
   cannot control either the length or the value of KEK beyond what can
   be obtained by rejection sampling, thus satisfying properties 1 and 2
   and defined in Appendix A.2.

   Therefore elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman is considered to be suitable
   for use with the simplified KEM combiner defined in Section 3,
   Figure 2.

A.5.  Edwards Curve Diffie-Hellman (X25519 / X448)

   The elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange [SEC1] can be promoted
   into a KEM in a straightforward way by assuming an ephemeral-static
   (ES) mode where def kemEncaps(pk) -> (ct, ss) includes generation of
   an ephemeral key pair, the public key being included as part of the
   ciphertext ct and the private key being discarded upon completion of
   the encapsulation.

   According to [RFC7748] section 6.1, the X25519 key exchange is
   defined as:

   Alice generates 32 random bytes in a[0] to a[31] and transmits K_A =
   X25519(a, 9) to Bob, where 9 is the u-coordinate of the base point
   and is encoded as a byte with value 9, followed by 31 zero bytes.

   Bob similarly generates 32 random bytes in b[0] to b[31], computes
   K_B = X25519(b, 9), and transmits it to Alice.

   Using their generated values and the received input, Alice computes
   X25519(a, K_B) and Bob computes X25519(b, K_A).

   Both now share K = X25519(a, X25519(b, 9)) = X25519(b, X25519(a, 9))
   as a shared secret.  Both MAY check, without leaking extra
   information about the value of K, whether K is the all-zero value and
   abort if so (see below).  Alice and Bob can then use a key-derivation
   function that includes K, K_A, and K_B to derive a symmetric key.

   The X448 key exchange follows a similar construction.

   The attacker is free to choose a private key b which yields a shared
   secret K, but cannot force K to take on a chosen value without
   solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem or performing

   rejection sampling.  Assuming a strong choice of KDF, the attacker
   cannot control either the length or the value of the derived
   symmetric key beyond what can be obtained by rejection sampling, thus
   satisfying properties 1 and 2 and defined in Appendix A.2.

   Therefore Edwards curve Diffie-Hellman, X25519 and X448, are
   considered to be suitable for use with the simplified KEM combiner
   defined in Section 3, Figure 2.

A.6.  CRYSTALS-Kyber

   The CRYSTALS-Kyber kemEncaps() is defined as follows
   [I-D.cfrg-schwabe-kyber]:

   1.Compute
     1. m = H(seed)
     2. (Kbar, cpaSeed) = G(m || H(pk))
     3. cpaCipherText = InnerEnc(m, publicKey, cpaSeed)
   2.Return
     1. cipherText = cpaCipherText
     2. sharedSecret = KDF(KBar || H(cpaCipherText))

   with definitions as per [I-D.cfrg-schwabe-kyber].

   Here the hash functions G, H and the key derivation function KDF are
   in theory chosen by the encapsulater, but in practice are fixed by
   the Kyber specification to be H: SHA3-256, G: SHA3-512, and KDF:
   SHAKE-256, which can be modeled as random oracles.  The attacker is
   free to choose m, but but not the decapsulater's public key pk, nor
   do they have control of cpaCipherText so long as InnerEnc remains
   IND-CPA secure.  Therefore the attacker cannot control the value or
   length of K beyond what can be obtained by rejection sampling.

   Therefore CRYSTALS-Kyber is considered to be suitable for use with
   the simplified KEM combiner defined in Section 3, Figure 2.

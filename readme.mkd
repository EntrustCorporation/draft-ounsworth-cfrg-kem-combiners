# KEM Combiners


## Setting up a build environment

There may be a way to do this in cygwin, but I cut losses and did it in ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
    $ sudo gem install kramdown-rfc2629
    $ sudo apt-get install xml2rfc


## Using the makefile

We have provided a makefile to build the draft in either pure TXT, or fancy HTML formats:

    $ make clean

    $ make txt
    or
    $ make html

The default target will build both:

    $ make clean
    $ make

## Editing Etiquette

When checking in changes to the document source (`.mkd`), please also check in the modified `.txt` for those who wish to review changes (diffs) in their browser.
